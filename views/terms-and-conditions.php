                        <p>I’ll admit, I was a bit skeptical before getting into this service. I literally have no computer background or any e-commerce knowledge. I was referred to Ecom Automation by a friend and I’m so glad I listened! I never imagined I could be a business owner, let alone have a business that I didn’t have to personally manage. At this rate, I’ll have a 7 figure business by this fall!</p>
